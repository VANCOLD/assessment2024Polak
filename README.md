# Valemus Assesment

## How to start the project

### Start Frontend
`cd ./frontend/`

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

### Start Backend
`cd ./backend/`

`npm install`

`node server.js`

## Libraries used

### Frontend
- React
- Router Dom
- Material Ui
- Material Ui Icons

### Backend
- express  
- dotenv
- cors

## General Remarks
I used vite to build the project, which was the way i was taught to initialize react project.

This will always install react + typescript and it is easy to do.

Things i havn't implemented:

- Validation (in Frontend / Backend, i marked the fields as required but there needs to be code to check if the fields are valid and if not they should be marked as such 

Careful, no .env is provided!

Those are the parameters i set up to be defineable for the nodejs backend
